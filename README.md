# Button-Ripple-Effect
Creating a button ripple effect involves adding a visual effect to a button where ripples emanate from the point of click. Here are the steps to create a button ripple effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Step 1: Set up your project structure
Create a new folder for your project. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.

Step 2: Write HTML markup
In the index.html file, create a button element where you want to apply the ripple effect.

Step 3: Style your button with CSS
In the styles.css file, add styles to create the button and the ripple effect.

Step 4: Add JavaScript for ripple effect
In the script.js file, write JavaScript code to handle the ripple effect when the button is clicked.

Step 5: Test your button ripple effect
Open the index.html file in a web browser. Click the button, and you should see the ripple effect emanating from the click point.
